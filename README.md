# Trip Service Kata

This is kata originally created by Sandro Mancuso [trip service kata](https://github.com/sandromancuso/trip-service-kata)
I watch a wonderful session at [MadridDotNet](https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/madriddotnet/) community. The event has hosted by Luis Ruiz Pav√≥n splendid as always and he posted an updated to dotnet core [trip-service-kata]("https://github.com/lurumad/trip-service-kata-net-core").
You can watch the [recorded session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAfBWZQWd1Q) and also watch a previous video of his on [clean code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhqcEKtO2Z8&list=PLWd8oJLXlnztHWR-GmEFBe_m8PY5t9Yv9&index=5)

This is my step by step solution to the kata following the guidelines set by Luis.
